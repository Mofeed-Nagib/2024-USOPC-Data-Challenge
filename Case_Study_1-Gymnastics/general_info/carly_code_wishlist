To-dos from meeting with Brian:
  -(Janson) Evaluate our different score predictions and suggest one to use. Fix MSE calculations and look into predict interval function
  -(Carly) work on optimizing simulation code
  -(Carly, later) Adjust how simulations decide who does what events
  -(Mofeed) Fix the vault qualify (simulate two for qualifying) (only the first counts for team and individual round) and the two are averaged to determine individual qualification

Other things we want to change:
  -Improve loop/simulation output
  -Handle tiebreakers
  -Think about a shiny!
  -Heavy lift item: turn select team loops into functions
