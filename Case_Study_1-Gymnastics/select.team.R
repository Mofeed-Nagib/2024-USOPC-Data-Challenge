## This script uses the distributions we created / scores we predicted in previous scripts
## to select the optimal gymnastics team!

# Use distributions of earlier/later scores to simulate Olympic scores for all gymnasts

# Select athletes that maximize scores in other countries

# Simulate how US teams perform relative to other countries, select US team with 'best' performance
# where 'best' means best weighted medal count
