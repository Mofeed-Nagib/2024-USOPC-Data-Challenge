## This script uses the distributions we created / scores we predicted in previous scripts
## to select the optimal gymnastics team!

# Run simulations
# In each simulation:

# Use distributions of earlier/later scores to simulate Olympic performances of other teams
# Maybe factor in additional considerations: potential injury, experience level. etc??

# Run through different possible US team constructions (is there a more efficient way than like looping through them? how to do this?)
# Simulate US team performance

# measure performance of US teams (by calculating a weighted medal count)

# Keep track of which USA team construction performs best

# At end of simulations, compare performances of different US team constructions
