Things we want to change:
  -(Carly) Re-organize our repo, split up select team scripts
  -(Janson/Mofeed) Evaluate our different score predictions and pick one
  -Eliminate some combinations of gymnasts that are not realistic (if they haven't competed in years, if they place really low)
  -Handle tiebreakers
  -Fix the vault qualify
  -Think about a shiny!
