Questions for Brian:

- How should we handle cases where sample size is low --> so st dev is pretty high -->
so our resulting Normal distribution has a significant tail in scores that seem unfeasible (negatives, very very low like below 5)
- What to do with cases that have one data point (should we just predict using that score? seems sus?)
- Good ways to visualize what is going on?
- I think we're still a little nebulous about simulations. Can you tell us a little
about how Jennie did it? Might go to her talk but in case I can't


Idea:
- Take competition location, make it just country
- Run a model predicting score when people are in home country vs not
