Questions for Brian:

- We are still thinking about how to handle the earlier scores. Not everyone has them, 
so how do we weigh/consider them fairly? (But on a basic level for distributing them we can just use 
similar method to later scores.)
- How should we handle cases where sample size is low --> so st dev is pretty high -->
so our resulting Normal distribution has a significant tail in scores that seem unfeasible (negatives, very very low like below 5)
- What to do with cases that have one data point (should we just predict using that score? seems sus?)
- Good ways to visualize what is going on?
- I think we're still a little nebulous about simulations. Can you tell us a little
about how Jennie did it? Might go to her talk but in case I can't
- We are trying to run an AIC and BIC model and struggling. Lot of data and lots of predictors to start makes it very difficult to extract the best ones.


Idea:
- Take competition location, make it just country (assess home court advantage)
- Run a model predicting score when people are in home country vs not


9/13 Meeting Notes:
- Handling low sample size cases: We could have a max st dev / make it impossible to score 
less than 0. We could also take a Bayesian approach....
  - Prior would be distribution of typical scores in an event.
  - But probably don't want to take that Bayesian approach, limited time/knowledge etc. Cap is better option.
  - Could make our own Bayesian-esque weighted average for athlete means and SDs
- Our distribution method seems like a good simple start! Yay!
- If we used a mixed effects model with lmer(),
  - allow new levels = TRUE in predict()
  - See 361 EV charging stations problem in final homework!
  - Tradeoffs: might not have as crazy of standard error issues? Worth trying out
- Step AIC is going to take forever and seems like a bad idea.
  - Might be best to test out lm's manually and remove variables and compare quality (using R-squared or AIC or BIC)
- Let's just ignore the earlier dataset for now! Not the most useful in its current state.
- We might need to do some manual fudging for some edge cases (young athletes, people who have been injured and out), and that is ok!
- We don't have info on judging bias but could try to do a home-field advantage thing.
- Simulations
  - Efficient ways to do it:
    - Instead of a nested for loop, generate all combos of teams (expand.grid) into a dataset
    - Make all combinations of predictions ahead of time
    - Can plug in a vector of means and sds to do simulations in one step
